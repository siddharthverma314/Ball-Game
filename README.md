This is a ball game I made when I was in seventh grade.

##What is it
* The aim of the game is to guide the ball around a maze till the end, marked in red.
* The maze is randomly generated using a variant of Prims Algorithm.

##How to Use
* enter the `/bin` directory
* type in the command `java ball.Randoms`. This should start the program.
